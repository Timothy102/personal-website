# How VCs Evaluate AI Startups

## Why Mistral AI Raised €113M with a Google Doc, but You Can’t Raise S***

€113M in Seed funding. With a Google Doc? Seriously?

That’s how much the French Mistral AI received in funding in June 2023.

Obviously, there’s VC money lying around. Why can’t you raise your $1M Seed for your AI startup then? This article is just about that.

In this article, I’m revealing:

- The framework VCs use to perform technical due diligence on AI startups.
- How you can use it to your advantage.

Here’s what this article contains:

1. The Risk Layer Onion Analogy  
2. Technical Due Diligence for AI Startups  
3. How VCs Think About AI with Regard to the Business Model  

Here’s what it does NOT contain:

- General tips like: “Get the best team to solve this problem.”  
- Mundane advice on evaluating anything other than AI startups.  
- Market or team references.  

## 1. The Risk Layer Onion Analogy

First, let’s start with a common reference from Marc Andreessen. This cute idea of yours—you call a startup—can be thought of in terms of risk layers that you have to peel before reaching Product-Market Fit (PMF) and ultimately returning money to the LPs.

Think of your startup as an onion. Each layer represents additional risk. The more layers you peel, the more VCs can be certain you can build a money-printing machine.

## 2. Technical Risk

Your team’s technical risk is the innermost layer of risk to address. This is the first place VCs will look to determine your chances of building and scaling the product. 

### Key Questions VCs Ask:

- How is the team structured to support scale?
- Are experienced people in leading positions?
- How are decisions about the tech stack being implemented? Hierarchically?
- Where does this product use third-party integrations? Are they integral? What happens if they fail?
- How hard is it to replicate the product?
- How far along is the product? Can users onboard and sales commence?
- Technology Readiness Level (TRL)?

## 3. High-Level System Design

### Key Considerations:

- What key features drive revenue generation? How do these align with market needs?
- Have you accounted for edge cases in your design? How do you plan to address them?
- Where do you foresee system bottlenecks under high demand? How will you address them?
- What are the current storage costs and scalability plans? How do they align with future needs?

## 4. Low-Level Structure

### The Four Layers of the Tech Stack:

1. Foundation Layer
   - How resilient is the physical hardware infrastructure, and what measures ensure uninterrupted communication with microservices?
   - Can the hardware scale efficiently to accommodate increasing workloads and demands?

2. Application Layer
   - Where is the code repository stored? What version control mechanisms are in place?
   - How is workload distribution managed across physical workers to optimize performance and resource utilization?

3. Delivery Layer
   - What load balancing mechanisms are employed to ensure even distribution of traffic?
   - How is caching utilized to enhance performance, and what strategies handle system overloads?

4. Management Layer
   - What processes govern updates or new feature deployments? How is the workflow managed?
   - What logging mechanisms track activities and diagnose issues effectively?
   - How is system monitoring conducted? What tools or metrics are used to ensure performance and identify potential issues proactively?

## 5. How VCs Evaluate AI Startups

### Model Builders, Integrators, or Vertical Players?

1. Model Builders
   - Building a new category unlocked by creating new ML models (general like Mistral, or use-case specific like Netflix).

2. Model Integrators
   - LLM fine-tuning with a huge vertical cost saving (e.g., 50x improvements).

3. Vertical Enterprise Players
   - Masters of sales-led growth. System design must account for high volatility and RPS scale.

### Data Strategy

- Proprietary models? Proprietary data?
- Can they build a feedback loop improving ML accuracy and acquiring new data?

### Direct Access to Customers

- Indicating proprietary distribution channels and reduced volatility compared to B2B third-party customers.

## 6. How AI Affects the Business Model Strategy

### Business Fundamentals

- Does AI unlock or enhance a new business model?
- Does it save people money/time or make people money/time? Or both?

### Growth Factors for AI Startups (Blitzscaling):

1. Market Size Assessment
   - VCs prefer a Serviceable Attainable Market (SAM) of over $5B.
   - Startups with a Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) exceeding $10M and 500% growth rates are highly attractive.

2. Gross Margins Evaluation
   - Startups with over 90% gross margins indicate profitability and scalability.

3. Distribution Strategy Analysis
   - Demonstrating effective strategies across multiple use cases to reach diverse markets.

4. Network Effects and Scalability
   - Leveraging network effects and demonstrating scalability accelerates growth.

### Growth Limiters in VC Evaluation of AI Startups:

1. Lack of PMF
   - Retention rates are key indicators. Strong retention is highly prioritized.

2. Operational Scalability Concerns
   - Addressing operational scalability, unit economics, and team scalability challenges.

## Conclusion

1. There are three types of AI startups: model builders, model integrators, and vertical enterprise players.
2. AI startups undergo rigorous technical evaluations similar to other highly technical startups, with emphasis on system design supporting positive feedback loops for models and data.
3. AI unlocks or vastly enhances business models. VCs demand 500% growth rates for attractive investments.
