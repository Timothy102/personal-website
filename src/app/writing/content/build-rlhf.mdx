# Build Your Own RLHF LLM - Forget Human Labelers

Self-play LLMs

### What You’ll Learn

1. How GPT-3.5 used RLHF to reinforce the LLM to become ChatGPT.  
2. A complete code walkthrough to train your own RLHF model.  
3. How to create a Self-Play LLM that reinforces itself without human labelers.

## 1. How GPT-3 Used Human Feedback to Reinforce the LLM

RLHF involves humans providing feedback (usually rankings) to evaluate the performance of an LLM. In the case of GPT-3.5, this human feedback was used to fine-tune the model, reinforcing desired behaviors.  

Human Policy: When a post (e.g., "The cat is flying through the air") is given, two summaries are selected. A human ranks which one is better.  
Result: With this feedback, GPT-3.5 underwent fine-tuning to improve its conversational ability, transforming it into ChatGPT.

## 2. Train Your Own RLHF Model

This section demonstrates how to create an RLHF model using custom datasets. The process involves three main steps:

### 2.1 Dataset Creation

Custom Dataset: Collect feedback by asking humans to rank language model responses to given prompts. This ranking helps to create a dataset of preferences.  
Label Studio: Use Label Studio to organize this data and label it according to human feedback.

### 2.2 Training a Preference Model

Preference Model: This model is trained on the labeled dataset to understand which response is preferred.  
Fine-tuning with PPO: The model is fine-tuned using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), connecting the feedback to improve the LLM's performance.

## 3. Self-Play Language Models (No Human Labelers Required)

The bottleneck of RLHF is the reliance on human labelers. However, a new approach called Self-Play Language Models can eliminate this need. Here’s how it works:

### 3.1 Self-Play with LLMs

Self-Play Process: The model generates responses to prompts, then uses its own judgment (based on internal evaluation) to determine the quality of these responses.  
Training Loop:
1. Generate Text: Model generates responses to prompts.  
2. Evaluate Text: Model uses a scoring function to evaluate its own responses.  
3. Update Model: The model updates itself based on the evaluation.  
4. Repeat: This process continues iteratively, allowing the model to self-improve.

### 3.2 Model as Judge

LLM-as-a-Judge: The self-play LLM acts as its own judge, making it capable of evaluating and improving itself without human feedback.

## 4. Train Your Own RLHF Model Without Human Labelers

With Self-Play LLMs, you can bypass human labelers entirely. Here’s how to proceed:

1. Use Pretrained Models: Start with a pretrained self-play model, such as one available in the HuggingFace library.  
2. Train the Self-Play LLM: Implement a training loop where the model generates, evaluates, and refines its responses.

By following these steps, you can build your own self-play LLM and eliminate the need for human labelers in the RLHF process.

### Summary

- Self-Play LLM Training: This method allows LLMs to train themselves autonomously, drastically reducing the need for human intervention.  
- No Need for Human Feedback: By utilizing self-play, you can achieve RLHF-like outcomes while leveraging pretrained models and fine-tuning them without human feedback.  
- Scalable RLHF Approach: Self-play LLMs offer a more scalable solution to RLHF, allowing the model to continuously improve through its own evaluation.
