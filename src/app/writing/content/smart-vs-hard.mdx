# Smart Work before Hard Work

The cluster of thoughts regarding work, both smart and hard, and how you can best utilize both to thrive.

Hard work might be perceived as a proxy for a designated personal execution plan, i.e., the way to go from A to B is ruthless execution. 

Coming from a hard-working environment, work has inevitably been ingrained in our lives, thoughts, and actions. In the past, I found it incredibly difficult not to work hard, not to set goals, and not to perform like your life is not on the line. Cynical small-minded working class people naturally link their hard work to their self-worth and conspire against the wealthier upper-class as per not having to work hard. However, working hard has its clear downsides:

1. For one, “finite games” with clear objectives are rare, if not impossible.
2. Merely working hard means you’re doing a lot of something repeatedly. It does not entail a sense of direction by itself. Nobody cares if you’re merely working hard. Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did work hard. In fact, he might be considered one of the toughest people ever. His accomplishments, however, are a direct result of his obnoxiously-devised single-minded plan to make something of himself. That “something” was as clear as it could be for Arnold.
3. It’s rather unsustainable.

Hard work has worked extraordinarily well for people with static menial jobs where the input-output relation can be clearly defined. However, the game of business, or life per se, are neither static nor have clear deliverables. That’s where smart work comes into play.

“Smart work” has certainly been synonymous with the behavior of wealthier people. And for good reason. Everybody works hard. Not everybody owns millions. You literally cannot work hard enough exchanging time for money to reach that kind of wealth. Therefore, wealthy people must know something you don’t.

Do you want to know if you’re working hard or smart?

### Working Hard Checklist

1. You’re thinking about becoming more productive, i.e., having a higher productive output per given unit of time. You’re always extracting work.
2. On top of your full-time job, you have multiple side projects.
3. You’re tired. If I gave you an out with a million dollars, you’d take it.
4. You derive your sense of self-worth by working hard. When you’re not working hard, you don’t feel accomplished.
5. When imposed with a problem, you’re the first to solve it.

### Working Smart Checklist

1. You often think about how to best utilize your time.
2. You’re spiritually connected to your work; you’re not tired by it. You’re single-minded about your goals.
3. You often think about building the future systemically. Everything that is not within the scope of your future, you don’t even bother, including people.
4. When imposed with a problem, you think who would be most suitable to know the answer.
5. You derive your sense of self-worth by impact.
6. You seek people, not things.

Execution does indeed matter, but not execution alone. A smart man once said: “It’s not about how hard you dig. It’s where you dig. If you dig at a river outlet, you create flow. If you dig in a desert, you create a hole.” Working hard is great, but is meaningless without great clarity and positioning. What you do is of insurmountably greater importance than how hard you work.

Smart and hard work are 2 different human modalities that can work incredibly well when in harmony. I believe people who can/have utilized “smart work” the most are those most in touch with their inner genius and naturally gravitate toward the 3 key touchstones in one’s “smart work” toolbox:

1. Set your non-negotiables.
    1. Values. What do you care about? Why? Who/what comes first?
    2. Connect with your inner genius. Bill Gates wouldn’t be able to utilize hard work before utilizing smart work first. And he wouldn’t be able to utilize his smart work without understanding himself, both his strengths and weaknesses.
2. People & Connections
    1. Whatever it is you do in your designated field, you are in the business of serving people.
    2. If you had worked half as much on forging connections and networking as you do working your ass off, you’d be way ahead. In those conversations, you will not only meet other people, but you will be acquainted with opportunities you couldn’t have been acquainted with previously. Meeting like-minded people shall also prompt a window into establishing a stronger sense of self. The more you know yourself, the more you allow people to present you with opportunities that you care deeply about.
3. Plan
    1. Plan like crazy. Have plans of plans, truly. Devise a 10-year career, wealth & family plan. Stick to it.
    2. Your unit of accomplishment is not time/work done; rather, your impact. And you cannot have impact without having clarity first.

In conclusion, hard work can work incredibly well when accompanied by the underlying smart work. Smart work makes hard work possible.
